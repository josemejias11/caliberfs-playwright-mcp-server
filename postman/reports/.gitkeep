# Postman Test Reports

This directory contains generated reports from Postman API test runs.

## Report Types

- **HTML Reports** - Visual test reports with charts and detailed results
- **JSON Reports** - Machine-readable test results for CI/CD integration
- **CLI Reports** - Console output from Newman test runs

## Generated Files

- `api-test-report.html` - Detailed HTML report with test results and charts
- `api-test-results.json` - JSON output for programmatic analysis

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated when running:
- `npm run test:api-detailed` - Generates HTML and JSON reports
- `npm run test:api` - Generates JSON reports only

Reports are gitignored to avoid committing large test output files.
